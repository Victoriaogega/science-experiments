            <p> Join us in challenging ourselves,enhancing our skills and having fun!</p>
            <p> We do challenges weekly to help us remember different Scientific principles and how we can use them in
                our daily lives to solve different issues. <br>We also do it because it is fun to assemble materials and
                create a functional tool or equipment from the materials.</p>
            <p>This sharpens our minds and helps us to think every time we are faced with an issue on how we can solve
                it. <br> It encourages and fosters innovation within us which is the reason why we keep doing it weekly.

                <p>
                    The machine solves the issue of propulsion without using electricity. <br>It explains how pressure
                    released in a
                    controlled manner can power up a boat and many<br> other things. It explains energy transfer, force
                    and motion.

                <h3>Energy efficiency and user-centred design</h3>
                <p>
                    The design emphasizes simplicity,reusability and accessibility. <br>It is made from materials that
                    are easily
                    available and affordable which are easily accessible. <br> From a human-centred perspective and easy
                    and safe to
                    make.The energy efficiency is about 7.5.

                    Styrofoam is a material that can float on water due to its low density . Its lightweight and porous
                    <br>
                    structure allows it to displace water that is equal to its volume, resulting in the buoyant force
                    needed for
                    it to float. <br> We connected it to a balloon using a straw. The balloon is attached at the back of
                    the
                    boat .
                    Once the balloon is <br> deflated and the boat placed on water, it starts to move. As the balloon
                    deflates, the
                    force pushes the boat to the <br> opposite direction because the compressed air rushes out through
                    the
                    straw. As
                    the air rapidly rushes out, it creates <br>a force that pushes the boat on water. This is based on
                    Newton's
                    third law of motion which states that for every action, <br> there is an equal and opposite
                    reaction. The
                    balloon
                    acts as the propulsion system for the boat; when it is inflated, it stores <br> a large amount of
                    air
                    under
                    pressure which is potential energy. The potential energy is converted to kinetic energy when the
                    <br> air
                    is
                    released and it propels the boat to the opposite direction.
