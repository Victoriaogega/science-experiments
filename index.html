            <p> We do challenges weekly to help us remember different Scientific principles and how we can use them in
                our daily lives to solve different issues. <br>We also do it because it is fun to assemble materials and
                create a functional tool or equipment from the materials.</p>
            <p>This sharpens our minds and helps us to think every time we are faced with an issue on how we can solve
                it. <br> It encourages and fosters innovation within us which is the reason why we keep doing it weekly.

                <h3>What the machine solves</h3>
                <p>
                    The machine solves the issue of propulsion without using electricity. <br>It explains how pressure
                    released in a
                    controlled manner can power up a boat and many<br> other things. It explains energy transfer, force
                    and motion.

                <h3>Energy efficiency and user-centred design</h3>
                <p>
                    The design emphasizes simplicity,reusability and accessibility. <br>It is made from materials that
                    are easily
                    available and affordable which are easily accessible. <br> From a human-centred perspective and easy
                    and safe to
                    make.The energy efficiency is about 7.5.

                <p>
                    Styrofoam is a material that can float on water due to its low density . Its lightweight and porous
                    <br>
                    structure allows it to displace water that is equal to its volume, resulting in the buoyant force
                    needed for
                    it to float. <br> We connected it to a balloon using a straw. The balloon is attached at the back of
                    the
                    boat .
                    Once the balloon is <br> deflated and the boat placed on water, it starts to move. As the balloon
                    deflates, the
                    force pushes the boat to the <br> opposite direction because the compressed air rushes out through
                    the
                    straw. As
                    the air rapidly rushes out, it creates <br>a force that pushes the boat on water. This is based on
                    Newton's
                    third law of motion which states that for every action, <br> there is an equal and opposite
                    reaction. The
                    balloon
                    acts as the propulsion system for the boat; when it is inflated, it stores <br> a large amount of
                    air
                    under
                    pressure which is potential energy. The potential energy is converted to kinetic energy when the
                    <br> air
                    is
                    released and it propels the boat to the opposite direction.

        </div>

        <!-- <h3>What worked and what did not</h3>
        <p>
            The balloon and boat worked as expected but the styrofoam was not enough so the boat was small. The straw we
            got was not flexible and so we had to put it behind the boat.
            The boat was able to move on water for quite a distance.
            If we had a bigger balloon it would move a larger distance.

                    Draw 1 Event Card.

                    All players read and apply the effect (e.g., “Cold Snap” may cause some rabbits to die).

                    Roll the die if required to determine the impact.

                <p>Some events will cause specific traits (e.g., “Thick Fur”) to help rabbits survive.

                    Rabbits without helpful traits may die based on the event or die roll.</p>

<div class="reproduction">
            <h2> 3.Reproduction Phase </h2>
            <p> This is where new rabbits are born

                Surviving rabbits can pair up if:

                They are still alive.

                The colony has at least 2 rabbits left. <br>
                How reproduction works:

                Choose any 2 rabbits in your colony to mate.

                Use the Reproduction Chart:

                Match their genotypes (e.g., BB and Bb) to determine the possible offspring genotype (e.g., BB, Bb, or
                bb).

                Use a die roll or probability to choose the offspring’s actual genotype.


                Pick a new rabbit card that matches the resulting genotype.

                Add the baby rabbit to your colony.


                (Example: BB x Bb could result in BB or Bb. If you roll even: BB. If you roll odd: Bb.)

                Note: Colonies can only reproduce if they have enough space. You may set a max of 8 rabbits per colony.

        <div class="drift">
            <h2>4. Drift Phase</h2>
            <p>Randomly remove one rabbit from each colony by rolling a die.

                This simulates genetic drift (random loss in a small population).

                This is where rare traits may disappear by chance, not survival skills.</p>
